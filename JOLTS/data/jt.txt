The following is a definition of:  Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)
	
Survey Description:  The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey program provides
national estimates of rates and levels for job openings, hires, and total 
separations.  Total separations are further broken out into quits, layoffs and
discharges, and other separations.

Unadjusted counts and rates of all data elements are published by supersector and select
sector based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  These
supersectors and select sectors include: Mining and logging; Construction;Durable goods
manufacturing; Nondurable goods manufacturing; Wholesale trade; Retail trade; Transportation,
warehousing, and utilities; Information; Finance and insurance; Real estate and rental and
leasing; Professional and business services; Educational services; Health care and social
assistance; Arts, entertainment, and recreation; Accommodation and food services; Other
services; Federal government; and State and local government.

Seasonally adjusted counts and rates of job openings, hires, total separations, and quits
are available for selected North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
supersectors. These supersectors include: Construction; Manufacturing; Trade, transportation, 
and utilities; Retail trade; Professional and business services; Education and health services;
Arts, entertainment, and recreation; Accomodation and food services; Government; and State 
and local government.

Estimates are also available for four geographic regions (Northeast, Midwest,
South, and West).

The sample for the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey includes randomly
selected nonfarm establishments such as factories, offices, and stores, as
well as federal, state, and local government entities in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia.  The 16,000 establishments in the JOLTS survey are drawn
from a universe of approximately eight million establishments compiled as 
part of the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, or ES-202, program.

All data series are available from December 2000 to present on a monthly and annual basis.

BLS seasonally adjusts selected JOLTS series using the X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment
program.  Seasonal adjustment is the process of estimating and removing periodic
fluctuations caused by events such as weather, holidays, and the beginning and ending of
the school year.  Seasonal adjustment makes it easier to observe fundamental changes in
the level of the series, particularly those associated with general economic expansions
and contractions.  A concurrent seasonal adjustment methodology is used in which new
seasonal adjustment factors are calculated each month, using all relevant data, up to and
including the data for the current month.

JOLTS uses moving averages as seasonal filters in seasonal adjustment. JOLTS seasonal
adjustment in-cludes both additive and multiplicative seasonal adjust-ment models and
REGARIMA (regression with auto-correlated errors) modeling to improve the seasonal
adjustment factors at the beginning and end of the series and to detect and adjust for
outliers in the series.

All levels are published in thousands and all rates are published in percent to one
decimal place.

Special characteristics of the data are footnoted where necessary.

Updating Schedule: First Closing estimates are usually available four to six weeks after
the end of the reference month.  At the same time, second closing estimates for the month
prior to the reference month also are released.  The month following the annual CES
benchmark revision, all JOLTS pertinent estimates are retabbed.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
jt.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by spaces; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)

1.  series_id		  17		JTS000000NEJOR

2.  seasonal		  1		S or U

3.  industry_code	  6		000000
